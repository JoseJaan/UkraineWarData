# Data Analysis: Vehicles Destroyed in the Ukraine War

## About:  
This project consists of a data analysis of vehicles that were damaged, captured, or abandoned during the Ukrainian War.  
All the data was collected from the [Oryx](https://www.oryxspioenkop.com/) database using web scrapping.  
The database can be found here:  

- [Ukrainian data](https://www.oryxspioenkop.com/2022/02/attack-on-europe-documenting-ukrainian.html)  
- [Russian data](https://www.oryxspioenkop.com/2022/02/attack-on-europe-documenting-ukrainian.html)  

## Requirements:  
- Python 3.12 or higher  

## How to use:  
The `data` folder already contains two CSV files that are generated by running `scrapping.ipynb`.  
Scraping can be executed at any time to update the data.  
The `analysis.ipynb` file contains all the code responsible for the analysis.  

At the time of the last update, this code performs four different analyses:  
- Top 10 vehicles lost by each side  
- Total losses by category  
- Loss status distribution  
- Captured vs. destroyed
